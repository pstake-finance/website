    "BTC_FAQ1_CONTENT": "Bitcoin liquid staking is a solution that allows BTC holders to stake BTC assets through a non-custodial route.

    "BTC_FAQ2_TITLE": "What is Babylon?",
    "BTC_FAQ2_CONTENT": "Babylon is a security-sharing protocol that allows users to stake BTC to secure an alternative PoS blockchain and earn rewards. Its innovation shares security from Bitcoin’s battle-tested proof-of-work network and applies it to PoS networks through its Layer-2 security solution. Best of all, Babylon achieves all this without users having to bridge their assets while allowing them to retain custody. ",
    "BTC_FAQ2_CONTENT_CONTINUE": "Our Bitcoin liquid staking solution is built on Babylon’s protocol, allowing you to earn yields to secure other PoS ecosystems.",
    "BTC_FAQ3_TITLE": "Is Bitcoin liquid staking live?",
    "BTC_FAQ3_CONTENT": "Bitcoin liquid staking is not live but is coming very shortly.",
    "BTC_FAQ4_TITLE": "How does Bitcoin liquid staking generate yield?",
    "BTC_FAQ4_CONTENT": "The pSTAKE BTC liquid staking solution is built atop the Babylon infrastructure. It lets users stake their BTC and mint yBTC, a yield-bearing liquid staking derivative. The yield is generated from Babylon’s security-sharing solution, which provides security to PoS blockchains while earning rewards for the additional security provided.",
    "BTC_FAQ4_CONTENT_CONTINUE": "It doesn’t stop there. pSTAKE is exploring additional routes for BTC holders to liquid-stake their assets and earn more yield through DeFi. ",
    "BTC_FAQ5_TITLE": "Is Bitcoin liquid staking custodial?",
    "BTC_FAQ5_CONTENT": "Bitcoin liquid staking is non-custodial. You don’t have to hand over custody of your assets to a third party. Instead, you can simply trust the audited code and smart contracts.",
    "BTC_FAQ6_TITLE": "Is Babylon’s staking protocol secure?",
    "BTC_FAQ6_CONTENT": "Babylon has gone through great lengths to ensure the security of its protocol. For example, the project has eight security audits so far from high-profile security ferns including Red4Sec, Consensys, and Pessimistic. The protocol also has an ongoing Bug Bounty program in a partnership with Immunefi, offering rewards up to $100,000 for any critical vulnerabilities found.",
