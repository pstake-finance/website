                        The value of 1 stkATOM goes on increasing as it accrues
                        staking rewards over time. This is because stkATOM
                        follows a cToken model whose value changes based on the
                        amount of underlying ATOM. Users staking/unstaking on
                        the pSTAKE protocol are charged the ongoing rate which
                        is displayed on the app UI.

                        stkATOM follows an exchange rate model (also known as
                        the cToken Model) which results in stkATOM increasing in
                        value against ATOM as the protocol accrues staking
                        rewards. Thus, 1 stkATOM is worth more after each reward
                        epoch, or 24 hours. Liquid stakers are given stkATOM
                        tokens at the prevailing exchange rate at the moment
                        they stake.

                        See the rewards section for further details. pSTAKE
                        charges 5% on liquid staking rewards, where 95% goes to
                        stkATOM holders and 5% goes to the protocol. In order to
                        pay for transaction fees, users may need to hold a small
                        amount of XPRT on the Persistence chain.
